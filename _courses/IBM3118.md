**1.1 Definitions**

This section provides key definitions for foundational concepts in embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT). These topics form the basis for understanding cyber-physical systems and their real-world applications.

**1.1.1 Embedded systems**

An **embedded system**is a specialized computing system designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger system. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are optimized for specific tasks and often operate with limited hardware resources.

Embedded systems are found in a wide range of applications, including:  
**Consumer electronics**(e.g., smartphones, smart TVs, digital cameras)  
**Automotive systems**(e.g., engine control units, infotainment systems)  
**Medical devices**(e.g., pacemakers, MRI scanners)  
**Industrial automation**(e.g., robotic controllers, programmable logic controllers)  

**Characteristics**

Embedded systems typically have the following characteristics:  
**Real-time operation**: They must process tasks within strict timing constraints.  
**Reliability**: Many applications require continuous, fault-free operation.  
**Resource constraints**: Limited memory, processing power, and power consumption.  
**Application-specific**: Designed to perform a dedicated function rather than general computing tasks.  

**Architecture**

An embedded system consists of both **hardware**and **software**components:  

**Hardware Components** 
**Microcontroller (MCU) or Microprocessor (MPU)**– The processing unit that executes program instructions.  
**Memory (RAM, ROM, Flash)**– Stores program code and runtime data.  
**Sensors & Actuators**– Interfaces for data acquisition and control.  
**Communication Interfaces**– Serial (UART, SPI, I2C), wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), etc.  

**Software Components** 
**Firmware**– Low-level software running on the device.  
**Operating System (if applicable)**– Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) or bare-metal programming.  
**Drivers & Middleware**– Handle hardware abstraction and communication.  

**Applications**

Embedded systems play a crucial role in modern technology. Some emerging trends include:  
**Edge computing**for AI processing in IoT devices.  
**Autonomous vehicles**with embedded AI controllers.  
**Wearable health devices**for continuous monitoring.  

**1.1.2 Internet of things**

**Introduction**

The **Internet of Things (IoT)**refers to a vast network of interconnected devices that communicate and share data over the internet. IoT systems integrate sensors, embedded controllers, and cloud-based services to enable automation and smart decision-making.  

**Key Components**

IoT systems consist of several layers:  

**1. Perception Layer (Devices & Sensors)** 
- Sensors collect real-world data (e.g., temperature, motion, pressure).  
- Actuators trigger actions based on received commands.  

**2. Network Layer (Communication & Connectivity)** 
- Wireless communication: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, 5G.  
- Wired communication: Ethernet, CAN bus, Modbus.  

**Edge & Cloud Computing Layer**
- **Edge computing**: Processes data locally for faster response times.  
- **Cloud computing**: Stores and analyzes large amounts of IoT data.  

**Application Layer (User Interaction & Services)**
- Smart home applications, industrial automation, healthcare monitoring, etc.  

Challenges in IoT  

Despite its benefits, IoT faces several challenges:  
- **Security vulnerabilities**: IoT devices are targets for cyberattacks.  
- **Scalability**: Managing billions of connected devices requires robust infrastructure.  
- **Interoperability**: Standardizing communication protocols across diverse devices.  

Future Trends  

The IoT landscape is evolving with emerging technologies:  
- **AI-powered IoT**for intelligent automation and analytics.  
- **5G networks**enabling ultra-fast, low-latency communication.  
- **Blockchain for IoT security**in decentralized networks.

# 2. Hardware

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on several key hardware components that work together to process, communicate, and act on data collected from the physical world. These components include actuators, embedded computing units, communication interfaces, and power management systems, all of which ensure the seamless integration of cyber and physical domains.

**2.1 Models of sensors and actuators**

**2.1.1 Common sensors**

Sensors are fundamental components in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) as they provide real-world data that enables decision-making, automation, and control. Depending on the application, different types of sensors are used to measure physical phenomena such as temperature, motion, pressure, or chemical composition. Below is a detailed explanation of common sensor types, including their working principles and applications.

**Potentiometer: a sensor to measure rotation**

```cpp
// Potentiometer - code to manipulate potentiometer

#define sensorPin A0 // define entrada analógica A0

int sensorValue = 0; // variável inteiro igual a zero
float voltage; // variável número fracionário

void setup(){
Serial.begin(9600); // monitor serial - velocidade 9600 Bps
delay(100); // atraso de 100 milissegundos
}

void loop(){
sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // leitura da entrada analógica A0
voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1024); // cálculo da tensão
}
Serial.print("Tensão do potenciômetro: "); // imprime no monitor serial
Serial.print(voltage); // imprime a tensão
Serial.print("Valor: "); // imprime no monitor serial
Serial.println(sensorValue); // imprime o valor
delay(500); // delay of 500 ms

**2.1.2 Actuators**

While sensors collect data, actuators perform actions based on that data. Actuators convert electrical signals into mechanical, thermal, or other physical actions, making them essential for automation and control in CPS.

LED (Light-Emitting Diode) can be considered an actuator in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Why is a LED an Actuator?

An actuator is any device that takes an electrical signal and converts it into a physical action. In the case of an LED:

It receives an electrical signal (voltage/current).
It converts electrical energy into light (a physical output).

Examples of LED as an Actuator in CPS:

Visual Indicators → Status indicators in IoT devices (e.g., Wi-Fi routers, industrial machines).

Automotive Systems → Brake lights and smart LED headlights in cars.
Smart Home Applications → LED lighting controlled via mobile apps or voice assistants.
Optical Communication → Infrared LEDs used in remote controls and Li-Fi technology.
Medical Applications → LEDs in pulse oximeters to measure blood oxygen levels.

Although LEDs don’t produce mechanical movement, they physically change their light output in response to an electrical signal, which qualifies them as light actuators.
