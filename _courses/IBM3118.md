# 2. Hardware

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on several key hardware components that work together to process, communicate, and act on data collected from the physical world. These components include actuators, embedded computing units, communication interfaces, and power management systems, all of which ensure the seamless integration of cyber and physical domains.

## 2.1 Models of sensors and actuators

### 2.1.1 Common sensors

Sensors are fundamental components in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) as they provide real-world data that enables decision-making, automation, and control. Depending on the application, different types of sensors are used to measure physical phenomena such as temperature, motion, pressure, or chemical composition. Below is a detailed explanation of common sensor types, including their working principles and applications.

Potentiometer: a sensor to measure rotation

Code to Using a `{: .block-tip}` attribute:

```arduino
// Potentiometer - code to manipulate potentiometer.

#define sensorPin A0 // define entrada analógica A0

int sensorValue = 0; // variável inteiro igual a zero
float voltage; // variável número fracionário

void setup(){
Serial.begin(9600); // monitor serial - velocidade 9600 Bps
delay(100); // atraso de 100 milissegundos
}

void loop(){
sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // leitura da entrada analógica A0
voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1024); // cálculo da tensão
}
Serial.print("Tensão do potenciômetro: "); // imprime no monitor serial
Serial.print(voltage); // imprime a tensão
Serial.print("Valor: "); // imprime no monitor serial
Serial.println(sensorValue); // imprime o valor
delay(500); // 500 ms delay
```

### 2.1.2 Actuators

While sensors collect data, actuators perform actions based on that data. Actuators convert electrical signals into mechanical, thermal, or other physical actions, making them essential for automation and control in CPS.

LED (Light-Emitting Diode) can be considered an actuator in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Why is a LED an Actuator?

An actuator is any device that takes an electrical signal and converts it into a physical action. In the case of an LED:

It receives an electrical signal (voltage/current).
It converts electrical energy into light (a physical output).

Examples of LED as an Actuator in CPS:

Visual Indicators → Status indicators in IoT devices (e.g., Wi-Fi routers, industrial machines).
Automotive Systems → Brake lights and smart LED headlights in cars.
Smart Home Applications → LED lighting controlled via mobile apps or voice assistants.
Optical Communication → Infrared LEDs used in remote controls and Li-Fi technology.
Medical Applications → LEDs in pulse oximeters to measure blood oxygen levels.

Although LEDs don’t produce mechanical movement, they physically change their light output in response to an electrical signal, which qualifies them as light actuators.
